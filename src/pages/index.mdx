Hello, I'm Kot! I write software.

Here's a few things I've made:

-   [shovel](https://github.com/kotx/shovel), a client for placing a lot of pixels on [Place IPv6](https://v6.sys42.net/).
-   [recorder](https://github.com/kotx/recorder), a Rust crate to simplify data struct creation.
-   [risu](https://github.com/kotx/risu), a Discord bot for a Safebooru image tag-guessing game.
